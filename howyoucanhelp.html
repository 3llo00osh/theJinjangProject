    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Volunteers</span></h5>
    <p>With your support we can:</p>

    <p>•	Help poor families send their children to school</p>
    <p>•	Help poor children in their studies to enable them to stay in school</p>
    <p>•	Help children learn new skills to be able to secure employment in the future</p>
    <p>•	Help women build a better life for themselves, their families and their community</p>

    <p>Volunteer as a teacher:</p>

    <p>>  We need teachers who can teach Primary Maths and English to children from Jinjang.
          Our classes are on Saturdays from 2 pm to 5 pm, in HELP University, KPD,  Jalan Dungun, Kuala Lumpur</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Learning Materials</span></h5>

    <p>>  We need help in curriculum design/development.
          Materials that we can use to teach these children.
          We have around 60 children taking Maths and another 60 taking English tuition with us each Saturday.
          We need materials that can be used by teachers as well as workbooks for the children.</p>
    <p>>  Each week, children will go through workbooks with exercises that will strengthen their understanding of the respective subjects</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Children school supplies</span></h5>

    <p>>	We need school bags, school shoes, socks, books, stationery, etc that can be used by the children to start the school year.
          Each year before Christmas (early December), we host a big Christmas event for the children from this community, where we provide games, songs and lunch for the children.
          At the end of the party, we will distribute school bags, stationery and other essential items to encourage them to get the new year started</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Sponsor a child</span></h5>

    <p>How the child sponsorship works:</p>

    <p> •	Contact us to find out the details of needy children</p>
    <p> •	Choose a child to sponsor</p>
    <p> •	Sponsor at least RM150 per month which will cover the cost of school bus, daily lunch allowance and compulsory school fees</p>
    <p> •	Alternately, your sponsorship can be pooled with other sponsors to support a child</p>
    <p> •	By sponsoring a child, you get to see the impact your sponsorship has on the child and on the community</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">E-Business</span></h5>

    <p>•	Empowering mothers out of poverty</p>

    <p>In all poor communities, girls and women bear the brunt of poverty.
       When families struggle with getting enough food to eat, or earn enough money to send their children to school,
       it is always the girls who find the last to eat and first to be kept home from school.
       In some communities like Jinjang, the girls will be the target of vices, especially if they are not able to find jobs to help sustain their families.
       In families with many children, the mothers struggle with finding jobs, as they still have very young children who need to be taken care of, at home.
       Unable to leave the home or join the work force, they remain destitute and helpless.
       When you empower a woman, she can become a catalyst for positive change, whose success can benefit the family and even her community.</p>
