        <h3><b>Longhouse folk struggle to meet tough conditions for new homes</b></h3>
        <h5><span class="w3-opacity">June 5, 2017</span></h5>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>After 25 years, 815 families living in the dilapidated Jinjang Utara longhouses are finally in the process of moving into their homes in PPR Seri Aman.
          However, conditions set by the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry to buy the units make some ineligible.</p>

          <p>Selangor and Federal Territories Community Association (Permas) president Arumugam Marimuthu
          said the residents were required to settle their rental arrears as well as RM3,771 in lawyer’s fee,
          sales and purchase agreement fee, Government Service Tax and maintenance fee to proceed with the purchase of units in PPR Seri Aman.
          There is also a RM100 booking fee.</p>

          <p>“Although the RM45 monthly rental was waived from 2014 onwards, some of the residents have raked up thousands of ringgit
          in rental arrears. Many of them are very poor, so how will they settle the outstanding amount plus afford the many payments
          needed to purchase a unit in PPR Seri Aman?</p>

          <p>“There are also costs involved with moving into a new home such as installing grilles, lights, fans and buying furniture,” he said.
          Arumugam, a long-time longhouse resident, said many of the 634 residents who drew lots for their units were desperately trying to settle their debt
          and payments.</p>

          <p>“I am afraid that some may turn to illegal money-lenders which will surely lead to other problems.
          A DBKL officer said those who fail to make the payment will be given PPR units
          in other parts of the city and will not be able to live in PPR Seri Aman in the future.</p>

          <p>“I urge the Government to be considerate to the residents here who have been forced to live in squalor all these years.
          “We are also concerned as to why 181 residents were not called to draw lots.
          “DBKL said they would be included in the next session, but we worry about their predicament since no date has been given.</p>

          <p>“Apparently, residents who own houses within 35km from PPR Seri Aman are also being turned down. This is not fair.
          “We were only supposed to be here for two to five years, but we have been here for 25 years.
          “The children of the original residents have all grown up and to contribute financially to the family, some of them own houses.</p>

          <p>“The second generation of residents who have been waiting for government housing will also be in limbo when the longhouses are demolished.
          “Since they are not eligible for units in PPR Seri Aman, I hope they will be given PPR units nearby,” he said
          Arumugam said the residents were facing many issues over the purchase of units.
          “For example, three residents who drew lots for their units last month have passed on and the transfer to their wives’ names is a tedious process.
          DBKL should make it easier for them,” he said.</p>

          <p>Kuppama Munian, 63, who lives with her son and two grandsons, said she was the family’s sole breadwinner as her son has not been able to secure a job.
          “I work as a cleaner and earn RM800 a month. I have rental arrears of RM5,500. How am I going to pay that amount with my low income.
          “I have spent more than RM3,000 fixing the leaking roofs, broken doors, piping, wiring although it is the responsibility of DBKL.
          “Now, I am being pressed for money. How am I going to raise it in three months,” she said in tears.</p>

          <p>Another resident G. Gunase-garan, 24, who lives with his younger sister, said his mother who was eligible for a unit in PPR Seri Aman died last month,
          and a DBKL officer told him that he would not be able to buy the unit anymore as he was unmarried.
          “I have a job as a cleaner and can afford to pay the instalment but the DBKL officer said since I am not married,
          I am only eligible for a bachelor’s house (rumah bujang) in Cheras. What about my sister?” he questioned.</p>

          <p>Kepong Community Service Centre head Yee Poh Ping said he hoped the ministry and DBKL would stop denying the longhouse residents their right to proper housing.
          “I hope the Government will grant every longhouse unit the eligibility to own a PPR Seri Aman unit. The second generation should not be forgotten and should be given a PPR unit nearby.
          “I also hope that DBKL will deal with each family on a case-by-case basis instead of imposing a blanket ruling, as these people are desperately in need of help,” he added.</p>

        <p>IT WAS a meaningful day for the Jinjang Utara community as more than 800 senior citizens and disabled group were presented gifts to share the joy of the upcoming Chinese New Year festival.</p>

           <p>Organised by the Jinjang Utara Tokong Mamat, a non-profit charitable organisation, this annual activity is aimed to ease the burden of the local community.
           Donations including provisions worth RM100 and ang pow were distributed to the senior citizens aged over 65 years old and the disabled.</p>

           <p>“We have been doing this for 14 years now and we are glad that every year, the number of donors have been increasing,” said Kepong Community Centre head Yee Poh Ping.
              Thanking all the donors for their continuous support, Yee said the Sentul Police Department has also been extremely supportive of this event.
              Attending the event for the third time, Sentul OCPD Asst Comm R. Munusamy said the charity event had benefitted the local community.
              “Last year, the crime rate dropped 10% compared with the year before,” he said, adding that effective measures were taken to tackle illegal drug activities in Jinjang Utara.</p>
